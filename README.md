# send

A simple utility I made to allow uploading multiple files and sharing them over a URL. Run `make image` to build the app. The only CLI arg is `-storage` which can be used to change the where in the filesystem things will be stored.

This app lives on [send.sadboi.dev](https://send.sadboi.dev). I use CF access to ensure that only allowed users can submit files.

I used the stylesheet from my jekill project because I am lazy.
